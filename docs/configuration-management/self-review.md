## Traceability

1. [Git history of changes](https://github.com/OOO-A2/IT-Product-Development-course/commits/main/). How many commits and size of each commit (in lines of code) were accomplished per day or per week/sprint

1. [Checks failed](https://github.com/OOO-A2/IT-Product-Development-course/actions/runs/19671650418/job/56341787364#step:5:15) in lints, tests and types (for TypeScript). Allows to track how much warning we had previously to how many we have now if any unresolved

1. [Number of issues](https://github.com/OOO-A2/IT-Product-Development-course/milestones) planed and solved per Sprint. Allows to understand the capability of a team and level of documentation per issue

## Summary

The major sub-component that should be improved is documentation of workflow and agreement on the integration between frontend and backend as it is the inevitable part of the working product. It should be clear on what endpoints on what pages are triggered, how and which data is transfered, etc. So that further product maintaing will be smooth.
