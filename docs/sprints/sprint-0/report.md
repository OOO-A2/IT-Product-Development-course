A brief report on what we've learned

- Preparing a detailed script without knowing customer problems is hard, broader questions should be asked.
- We need to identify customer type (ours is technical) and get advantage of it.
- Effective use of AI tools accelerated work. Audio transcription was automated to save manual effort, interview questions were structured logically to improve information gathering.
- Collaboration within the team and with the customer is key to refining requirements and delivering value.

During next meetings we will clarify on the vision of MVP (what features must be their and what are the priorities), and discuss quality attributes. Hence, identifying attributes we will figure out what can bring the most value. We can also estimate how much time a proposed MVP will reduce by automation some processes. Also we will define clear acceptance criteria and develop test plans for critical functionalities.
