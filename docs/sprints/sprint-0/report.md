A brief report on what we've learned

- Preparing a detailed script without knowing customer problems is hard, broader questions should be asked.
- We need to identify customer type (ours is technical) and get advantage of it.
- 

During next meetings we will clarify on the vision of MVP (what features must be their and what are the priorities), and discuss quality attributes. Hence, identifying attributes we will figure out what can bring the most value. We can also estimate how much time a proposed MVP will reduce by automation some processes.
