"Let's walk through what we've deployed based on your feedback:

Dashboard Improvements Shown:
Team-focused view: "You mentioned wanting to see teams first - now that's the default"

Collapsible grades: "We implemented collapsing A/R/I/C into 'Team Grade' as discussed"

Extra column: "Individual grading is now separate from team grades"

Peer Review Updates:
Dual PDF upload: "Students can now upload both commented work and summary"

Assignment grade field: "Added the column you requested for assignment grading"

Mom Test Question: "Looking at this team dashboard now, does this match how you typically review student progress each week?"

3. How We Addressed Specific Feedback (5-7 min)
"You gave us clear direction on several points. Here's how we implemented them:

Feedback → Implementation
"Too many columns" → Collapsed into Team Grade + Extra

"Need assignment grades in peer review" → Added dedicated column

"Two PDFs needed" → Implemented dual upload system

"Fixed headers for scrolling" → Headers now stay in place

Validation: "When you last graded assignments, what part was most time-consuming? Does this new layout help?"

4. Access & Usage Guide (3-5 min)
"Here's how to access and use the current version:

Access:
URL: [Production URL]

Key Workflows:
Grading workflow: Team view → Expand for individuals → Enter grades

Hands-on: "Would you like to try entering a grade for a test team right now?"

5. Strategic Plan & MVP Progress (10-12 min)
"Looking at our overall progress toward MVP:

Completed (Core MVP):
Team/student progress tracking

Basic grading interface

Peer review submission system

In Progress (Next 2 weeks):
Enhanced peer review workflow

Grade calculation formulas

Export functionality

Backlog Prioritization:
Must have: Peer review completeness tracking

Should have: Automated grade calculations

Could have: Advanced analytics

Question: "Based on your upcoming grading cycles, which feature would provide the most immediate value?"

6. Scope Negotiation & Next Steps (10 min)
"We need to align on what's essential for the next milestone:

Options for Next Sprint:
Option A: Complete all peer review features (2 PDFs, assignment grades, bulk download)
Option B: Focus on grade calculation formulas and dashboard enhancements
Option C: Split efforts between both with reduced scope

Trade-off Discussion:
"If we choose Option A, we delay analytics by 2 weeks"

"If we choose Option B, peer review workflow remains manual in parts"

Decision Point: "Given your immediate needs, which creates more value: perfecting peer reviews or enhancing grade visibility?"

7. Action Items & Closing (5 min)
Agreed Actions:

[Team] → Implement [chosen option] by [date]

[Customer] → Test current deployment this week

[Both] → Schedule follow-up after next grading cycle

Next Meeting: [Proposed date] - Focus on [topic based on choice]

Final Check: "Is there anything from today's discussion that needs clarification before we proceed?"
