# What went well?
## 1. Improved Project & Backlog Management
We established a clearer backlog structure in GitHub Projects and began breaking down epics into smaller, manageable tasks. This helped the team align on sprint goals and track progress more transparently.
## 2. Effective Prototyping & Customer Alignment
The prototype successfully facilitated clear communication with the customer. By visualizing dashboard changes and peer review workflows, we received specific, actionable feedback that directly shaped our priorities and prevented misunderstandings.
## 3. Successful Feedback Incorporation
We efficiently translated customer feedback into concrete action points. For example, the decision to collapse multiple grade columns into a single "Team Grade" column addressed the customer’s need for clarity without losing functionality.

# What problems did we encounter?
## 1. Backend connection
Our backend developer has very little time because of the workload, so he I set aside a weekend to do this work.
## 2. Customer meeting
Most of our team was unable to go to the meeting with the customer, so it was held between customer and one of the teammates who is responsible for frontend. 

# Actionable Changes for Next Sprint
## High Impact
1. Define Explicit Acceptance Criteria per Task
Action: Each task must include 2–3 bullet-point acceptance criteria (testable conditions) before development starts.
Why: Prevents incomplete implementations and reduces rework.

2. Setup Basic CI/CD Pipeline
Action: Implement a minimal GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and deploy the frontend to a staging environment on every push to main.
Why: Enables faster feedback and ensures the deployed version is always up-to-date and testable.

## Medium Impact
1. Introduce Structured Internal Demos
Action: Hold a 15-minute internal demo at the end of each week where developers show what they’ve built.
Why: Improves cross-team awareness and catches integration issues earlier.

## Low Impact
1. Standardize Communication Templates
Action: Create a shared template for meeting notes and action points to ensure consistency and clarity.
