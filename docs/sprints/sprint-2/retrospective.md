# Sprint 2 Retrospective

## What went well

1. Drafting of Figma prototyped pages in React - it looks much better than in Figma;
2. More structured customer session organization - notes taking during the meeting;
3. Understanding major roles and responsibilities of each team member - separating github work with requirements prototyping;

## Problems encountered

1. Generated frontend code requires time to refactor to be maintainable and consistent. Solution: improve prompts, understand the design and general architecture of the website - still in progress of solving;
2. Team unsyncronized on the responsibilites and vision of the development. Solution: we conducted an additional team meeting for synchronization to disscuss all the roles and product vision;

## Changes for next Sprints

1. High impact: roles distribution - one team member will focus on managing github project (tables, backlog, tasks, etc.), another on requirements engineering, documentation and communication in team, others: backender and frontender mainly;
2. Medium impact: introduce development branches for backend and for frontend with further potential staging branch to merge them in - at the end of sprint merge to main;
3. Low impact: instruct all team members to check headers of md files in docs folder for proper static pages generation;
