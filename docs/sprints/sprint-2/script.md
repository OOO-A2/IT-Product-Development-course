## 1. Introduction
"Thank you for meeting with us today. We want to understand your current workflow and challenges to build something that truly helps professors and the TAs. We'll be recording for our notes and may ask follow-up questions about specific experiences".

## Login Page

### What we show:

Basic login interface without functionality

### Key discussion points

- "Is this layout sufficient for our initial version?"

- "Should we add any additional fields or information here?"

## Dashboard Demo Structure

### What we show:

Scrollable grades table with all student data

Export to CSV and save functionality

Current column structure (average calculations)

### Key discussion points:

- "Should we add an 'Extra' column for each week?"

- "Currently shows individual students - should we switch to team view first?"

## Team Grading Page

### What we show:

Separate page for grading teams by sprint

Team list with A/R/I/C grade inputs

### Key discussion points:

- "Should this be a separate page or integrated into the main dashboard?"

- "If we combine two pages, should we use collapse/expand for teams?"

## Student View Page

### What we show:

Student's personal grade view

Team members display

Peer review assignments

### Key discussion points:

- "What's missing from this student view?"

- "Should students see individual vs team grades differently?"

- "How should peer review assignments be displayed?"

## Peer Review Management

### What we show:

Table showing which team reviews which team

Status indicators and view document links

Current grading interface

### Key discussion points:

- "How should document links be managed (Google Drive vs platform)?"

- "Should teams submit grades through the platform or just in PDFs?"

- "What grading workflow works best for instructors?"

## Conclusion

- "So to summarize: dashboard changes, remove separate team page, add peer review columns?"

- "Which of these should be highest priority for implementation?"

- "Any other pages or flows we missed?"
