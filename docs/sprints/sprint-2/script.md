## 1. Introduction
"Thank you for meeting with us today. We want to understand your current workflow and challenges to build something that truly helps professors and the TAs. We'll be recording for our notes and may ask follow-up questions about specific experiences".

## Dashboard Demo Structure

- "When we show the main grading table, what information would be most valuable to see populated?"

- "Should we demonstrate with real student data or placeholder data?"

- "What's the first action you'd typically take when opening a grading dashboard?"

## Feature Prioritization for Demo

- "If we only have 30 minutes, which 3 features are absolutely essential to see?"

- "What's the most critical workflow we need to validate today?"

- "Should we focus on the most common use cases or edge cases first?"

## Navigation & Flow

- "How do you typically move between different grading tasks in your current workflow?"

- "When grading teams, do you usually work team-by-team or assignment-by-assignment?"

- "What information do you need to see together vs. separately?"

## Integration Points

- "Where should we start the story: at the beginning of the grading process or with the final results?"

- "How important is it to see the connection between peer reviews and final grades?"

- "Should we demonstrate the export functionality early or save it for the end?"

## Feedback Collection Approach

- "As we go through each section, what type of feedback would be most helpful?"

- "Should we pause after each major feature or do a complete walkthrough first?"

- "What's the best way for you to give feedback - comments as we go, or summarized at the end?"

## Decision-Making Flow

- "When we show alternative approaches, how do you prefer to evaluate them?"

- "Should we present options side-by-side or sequentially?"

- "What information do you need to make decisions about feature preferences?"

## Technical Depth

- "How technical should we get with the implementation details?"

- "Do you want to see the mobile responsiveness early or focus on desktop first?"

- "Should we include backend considerations or stick to frontend user experience?"

## Use Case Coverage

- "Should we walk through a specific scenario (like end-of-sprint grading) or show general capabilities?"

- "What's the most complex grading situation we should demonstrate?"

- "How important is it to see both individual and team grading workflows?"

## Closing & Next Steps
- "After seeing the demo, what's the most important question we should answer?"

- "What information would help you prioritize what we build next?"

- "Who else needs to see this before we can make decisions?"
