A brief report on what we've learned

1. Enhanced Collaboration & Requirements Elicitation
Prototyping in Figma is an extremely useful tool to discuss flows and features with the customer. The customer can directly see and compare what is absent to express his need.
Engineering Quality Perspective: This practice directly improves Usability and validates Correctness. By creating an interactive model, we move from abstract requirements to a tangible artifact. This reduces ambiguity and ensures the system's functions align with user expectations before development begins, saving significant rework effort.
2. Effective Meeting & Communication Management
The discussion with enthusiastic customers might take longer than 1 hour, need to be prepared.
During the meeting we should take notes on what we are discussing to be more precise in writing a summary after the meeting.
Engineering Quality Perspective: This is fundamental to maintaining project Maintainability and Testability. Clear, precise, and agreed-upon meeting summaries form a reliable audit trail. This documented decisions and requirements, which is crucial for future maintenance and for creating accurate test cases. Unprepared, unstructured meetings are a major risk to project scope and quality.
3. Project Planning & Architectural Decomposition
Teammate's Point: Task splitting is very important as initially high workload is effectively solved with all team members participating.
Engineering Quality Perspective: This is the core of building a Modifiable and Scalable system. Breaking down epics into smaller, manageable tasks (a process akin to architectural decomposition) allows for parallel development, easier integration, and more flexible scheduling. It directly impacts our Reliability by allowing us to focus on and thoroughly test smaller, well-defined components.
4. Tooling for Quality Control & Process Integrity
We learned how to set up GitHub projects and work with epics, backlog, priorities, etc.
Engineering Quality Perspective: Using a tool like GitHub Projects is not just administrative; it's a quality control mechanism. It enforces process, ensures Traceability (linking code commits to specific tasks), and provides visibility into the project's health. This structured approach is critical for Maintainability and managing the Evolution of the product, as every change can be tracked back to a requirement.
