A brief report on what we've learned

- Prototyping in Figma is extreamly useful tool to discuss flows and features with the customer. The customer can directly see and compare what is absent to express his need;
- The discussion with enthusiastic customers might take longer than 1 hour, need to be prepared;
- Task splitting is very important as initially high workload is effectively solved with all team members participating;
- We learned how to set up GitHub projects and work with epics, backlog, priorities, etc.
- During the meeting we should take notes on what we are discussing to be more precise in writing summary after the meeting;
