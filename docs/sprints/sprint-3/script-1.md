# Customer Meeting Script - Progress Review
### Quick Recap
"Last time we discussed several improvements for the grading dashboard. Let me quickly confirm our understanding of the key changes needed:"
## Deployed Version Demonstration

### Live Dashboard Walkthrough
*[Share screen with updated dashboard]*

"Based on your feedback, we've implemented:"

Completed Changes:
- Sum Calculation: "You mentioned average grades were misleading - now we show total sums"
- Team Collapse: "Remember when you described scrolling through individual students? Now teams can be collapsed"
- Extra Column: "We added the 'E extra' column as discussed"

### Mom Test Validation
- "Looking at this collapsed team view, does this match how you typically review grades?"
- "In your recent grading sessions, would this layout have saved you time?"

## Specific Feedback Implementation

### Addressed Issues
"We focused on the exact problems you described:"

Fixed Headers: "You mentioned scrolling issues - headers now stay fixed"
Integrated Grading: "No more switching between pages - everything's in one table"
Grade Structure: "A, R, I, C, Extra columns implemented as specified"

### Mom Test Check
- "When you last graded assignments, what was the most frustrating navigation issue?"
- "Does this integrated view match your actual grading workflow?"

## Backlog & Next Steps

### Current Priority Status
Implemented:
- Dashboard table redesign
- Sum calculation
- Team collapse functionality

Next Priorities:
- Peer review columns (submission status, review given)
- Document link management
- Grade submission requirements

### Mom Test Prioritization
- "Thinking about last week's peer review session, which missing feature caused the most delays?"
- "What administrative task took the most unexpected time recently?"

### Final Validation
- "Will these changes address the actual problems you faced in the last grading cycle?"
- "What one issue remains that would still require workarounds?"
