# Sprint 3 Retrospective

## What went well? List 3 things.

1. Customer meeting was time limited this time, so we could discuss all important implementations and agenda even faster. 
2. One of our developers had work trip and his tasks weren't delayed becsuse they were taken by other team members.
3. This week prior tasks were done in advance that gave us an opportunity to recheck all assignments. 

## What problems did you encounter and how you did or didn’t solve them? Provide 2-3 problems and their root causes.

1. It is not clear how to groom the sprint when everything almost done and customer don't add new features.
2. Generation and commit of the badge for percentage test coverage demonstration without using side services. From CI/CD workflow it appeared nontrivial task taking into account the availability branch protection rule (main accepts pushes when test job is succeeded).

## What will you change in the next Sprint to improve effectiveness? Provide 3-4 actionable changes prioritized by impact (High, Medium, Low). Choose 1-2 with the highest impact to apply in the next Sprint.
1. High impact: To receive clarifications from customer with prioritization and planning.
2. Medium impact: To provide backend developer's instructions (which endpoints, are there any differences in data format with frontend) for fronted developer fo the next sprint. 
3. Low impact: To collect more questions for the customer interview to cover more information
