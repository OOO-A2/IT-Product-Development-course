## Sprint Retrospective

**Did you achieve the Sprint Goal?**
Yes, the Sprint Goal was largely achieved.

**Why do you think so?**
The team successfully completed the planned Configuration Management activities, including documenting configuration artifacts, reviewing traceability, and improving repository hygiene. All required documents for the sprint were created or updated and aligned with the assignment objectives.

**What went well? (3 things)**

1. Clear structure and consistency across documentation made configuration artifacts easy to review and assess.
2. Improved traceability between backlog items, documentation, and implementation increased overall project transparency.
3. Effective collaboration within the team ensured timely completion of sprint tasks.

**What problems did you encounter and how you did or didn’t solve them?**

1. **Incomplete traceability in earlier artifacts** – Root cause: traceability was not prioritized in previous sprints.
   *Resolution:* Partially solved by adding explicit links and references during this sprint.
2. **Time spent aligning documentation formats** – Root cause: lack of shared documentation standards early in the project.
   *Resolution:* Solved by agreeing on common templates and structure.
3. **Limited automation for configuration checks** – Root cause: manual processes were favored due to time constraints.
   *Resolution:* Not solved in this sprint; deferred to future improvements.

**What will you change in the next Sprint to improve effectiveness?**

* **High:** Introduce stricter traceability rules between backlog items, commits, and documentation. *(Apply next sprint)*
* **High:** Add lightweight automation (e.g., CI checks) to support configuration consistency. *(Apply next sprint)*
* **Medium:** Define documentation standards earlier in the sprint.
* **Low:** Schedule mid-sprint check-ins focused on Configuration Management quality.

**What did you learn in this Sprint?**
We learned that Configuration Management quality strongly depends on early decisions about traceability, documentation structure, and automation, and that addressing these aspects incrementally is more effective than postponing them to later sprints.
