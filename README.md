One-line description

## Project goal(s)

The major goal is to replace static and tediously updated spreedsheet solution with a more interactive and functional platform/website to:
- Track scores of students and teams;
- Automate peer-feedback process;
- Possibly integrate with Google drive and Moodle.

## Threshold of Success

A project is considered to be successful if it provides the same functionality as current spreadsheet solution and more convenient grade description (by clicking on a team or a student) and automates peer-feedback assignment matching (a team understands who they need to provide feedback to).
